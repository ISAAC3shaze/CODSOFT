This repository contains three Java projects that demonstrate different aspects of programming and application development.

## 1. Number Game

### Description:
A simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.

### Features:
- Uses `java.util.Random` for random number generation.
- Accepts user input via `java.util.Scanner`.
- Tracks total score based on the number of attempts.
- Allows the user to play multiple rounds.

### Usage:

```bash
javac Numbergame.java
java Numbergame


# Student Grade Calculator

This Java project calculates the average percentage and assigns a grade based on marks obtained in a specified number of subjects.

## Description

The Student Grade Calculator program allows users to input marks for a set number of subjects and computes the average percentage. Based on this percentage, it assigns a grade according to predefined grading criteria.

## Features

- **Input Handling**: Validates user input to ensure marks are within the valid range (0-100).
- **Average Calculation**: Computes the average percentage based on the total marks obtained.
- **Grade Assignment**: Assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average percentage using predefined grading thresholds.
- **Simple Console Interface**: Uses basic console input and output for interaction.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   javac StudentGrades.java



# ATM Interface

This Java project simulates an ATM interface where users can perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

## Description

The ATM Interface project provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with their bank account. It includes features like balance checking, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and exiting the ATM system.

## Features

- **Check Balance**: View the current balance of the bank account.
- **Deposit**: Add funds to the bank account.
- **Withdraw**: Deduct funds from the bank account, if sufficient balance is available.
- **Exit**: Quit the ATM interface.

## Usage

To run the program:
1. Compile `ATMINTERFACE.java`:
   ```bash
   javac ATMINTERFACE.java
